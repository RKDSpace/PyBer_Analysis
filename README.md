PyBer - Ride Sharing Analysis
# Overview:
Iâ€™m working on putting together some analysis for my manager V. Isualize. She would like me to put together a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. I will use Pandas and Matplotlib to create a multi-line graph to show the total weekly fares for each city type (Suburban, Urban and Rural). This analysis will show how the data differs between each city type and how those differences can help V. Isualize and other stakeholders.
