PyBer - Ride Sharing Analysis
# Overview:
I’m working on putting together some analysis for my manager V. Isualize. She would like me to put together a summary DataFrame of the ride-sharing data by city type. I will use Pandas and Matplotlib to create a multi-line graph to show the total weekly fares for each city type (Suburban, Urban and Rural). This analysis will show how the data differs between each city type and how those differences can help V. Isualize and other stakeholders.
# Results:
The results of the analysis will show differences in the ride sharing data among the different city types. Rural has the least number of total rides, while Urban has the largest number of total rides. This correlation makes sense because Urban city types would have higher population than other city types. The same analysis could be said for the total drivers. The total drivers are also less in Rural city type as opposed to Urban city types. While the first two data points make sense because Rural cities are less populated, the more interesting points comes when looking average fares per ride and average fares per driver. The average fares per driver are higher in Rural areas (meaning even though they have less rides those riders are paying more). The average fare per driver is also higher in the Rural city types. When there are less drivers to choose from Rural area residents don’t have a lot of choices between drivers. It also could be due to Rural issues cause drivers to driver further in distance which would cause most in the long run per drive. Suburban and Urban areas are more populated, and those areas rides might not be as far in distance. The data clearly shows that Urban city type is the largest in all categories overall except for fare prices. This could have also been expected.

A multi-line graph is also a good visual representation of the data frame above. This graph shows the total fares by city type from January to end April/ beginning of May. As previously discovered the Urban city has the highest fares with Rural as the lowest. The interesting connection this graph shows is that they all follow the same pattern of spikes and dips. In the end of February to Beginning of March there is a clear spik in the fares in Suburban cities. At the same time Urban and Rural cities also saw a spike followed by a dip. This could be a spike due to spring vacation time. The rest of the spike and dips appear to follow the same pattern.

# Summary:
As the data has seen Rural has the lowest number of riders with a costly fair. This represents an unfair advantage to the residents in that area. One recommendation in this area could be allocate incentives to drivers to go to Rural areas during peak travel times throughout the year to riders in that area more options for travel. 
A second recommendation I would give is to do some marketing campaigns. These campaigns can help to advocate for riders or drivers where ridership is low and prices are high (such as Rural cities). Marketing campaigns can also help to saw Suburban ridership to rival with that of Urban cities because they are consistently I the middle of the row between Rural and Urban cities. 
A final recommendation I would give is to do some more research and surveys amongst drivers and riders to see what concerns are for each population to help resolve the disparities between the different city types. For instance, are there riders in Rural cities that would like to travel to Urban cities but can’t because of the higher costs or is there something else that can’t be seen in the data alone among the riders/drivers.
